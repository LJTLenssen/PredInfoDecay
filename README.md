# Predictive Information Decay
This repository is indented to study ‘predictive information decay’ as a dynamical extension to predictive information. From data, it measures how far into the future one should be able to make meaningful predictions given the past. For now we look at a class of stochastic processes – random walks on graphs – and observe that the way predictive information decays is dependent on all the spatial information of a system.
